**Situation**:  
In the InfoSec team at FedEx, we needed a solution to monitor critical data for anomalies and security issues in real time. This project required detecting unusual patterns, raising alerts for any priority issues, and enabling proactive security measures. Additionally, FedEx InfoSec needed a way to analyze and visualize this data through interactive dashboards to gain insights quickly and effectively.

**Task**:  
My role was to develop a robust, real-time anomaly detection and alerting system, complete with data analysis and visualization. This system needed to detect and flag potential security risks, dynamically configure task parameters, and publish relevant updates for analysis. I also needed to integrate dynamic alerts and visualization dashboards for real-time data monitoring and quick response.

**Action**:
1. **Anomaly Detection and Priority Alerts**:
    - I implemented a **Python microservice** dedicated to anomaly detection, using pattern recognition algorithms to flag suspicious data behavior. This service continuously analyzed data, identified irregularities, and assigned priority levels based on the severity of the detected anomalies.
    - To enhance visibility, I set up **dynamic alerts** integrated with **Microsoft Teams webhooks**. These alerts allowed our team to receive immediate notifications of high-priority security events, enabling prompt response and escalation.

2. **Real-Time Data Publishing and Analysis**:
    - To support real-time insights, I modified the core logic to publish detected anomalies to a **Kafka topic**. This enabled a seamless flow of security updates that the Python microservice could consume for ongoing analysis, establishing a loop for continuous monitoring.
    - By using Kafka’s streaming capabilities, I ensured that all anomalies were processed and analyzed in near real-time, allowing the team to take swift action on any identified security threats.

3. **Configurable Task Management and Scalability**:
    - I designed the system to be **dynamically configurable**, allowing new tasks or anomaly detection parameters to be added on demand. This flexible architecture enabled the team to adapt to new security requirements without needing to redeploy the microservice.
    - The task configuration was centrally managed and supported through an intuitive interface, providing non-technical team members with the ability to adjust detection parameters as needed.

4. **Data Visualization and Dashboards**:
    - I developed **Microsoft Power BI dashboards** to visualize the detected anomalies and highlight trends in security events. These dashboards provided real-time insights into the nature, frequency, and location of detected issues, aiding the InfoSec team in identifying patterns and potential vulnerabilities.
    - Each dashboard was interactive and customizable, allowing stakeholders to drill down into specific data points and analyze trends over time.

**Result**:  
The solution provided FedEx’s InfoSec team with a powerful, real-time anomaly detection and alerting system, significantly improving their ability to respond to security events. The integration of Teams webhooks for priority alerts enhanced responsiveness, while the dynamic task configuration allowed the team to quickly adjust to new threats. The Power BI dashboards offered comprehensive visualization, making data-driven insights accessible and actionable. Overall, this project strengthened FedEx’s security posture by enhancing real-time threat monitoring and response capabilities.
