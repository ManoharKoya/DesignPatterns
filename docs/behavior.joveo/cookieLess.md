**Situation**:  
At Joveo, a programmatic job ad-tech company, revenue was directly tied to accurately tracking user conversions from ad views to job applications. Historically, this tracking depended on third-party cookies. However, as browsers like Safari, Firefox, and Brave began restricting third-party cookies, our tracking capabilities were compromised. Apple devices, for instance, only retained cookies for seven days, meaning users who returned after a week were counted as new users. This gap reduced our visibility into returning users and directly impacted Joveo’s revenue by decreasing recognized conversions.

**Task**:  
To maintain high conversion tracking accuracy and ensure revenue continuity, Joveo required a sophisticated cookie-less tracking solution. This solution needed to reliably identify returning users without cookies, particularly across restricted browsers, and to be job-specific to track the source and engagement of users accurately.

**Action**:
1. **Research and Design of a Cookie-Less Tracking System**:
    - I conducted extensive research on privacy-compliant tracking approaches and designed a robust solution that centered on generating a unique, consistent identifier—or "hash"—for each user.
    - This hash was constructed using a combination of factors including the user’s **IP address**, **user agent**, **URL**, and the **job requisition ID** to create a unique, job-specific identifier. The addition of job requisition ID ensured that tracking remained precise and segmented by job postings, aligning closely with our ad-tech requirements.

2. **Implementation of the Cookie-Less Tracking Pipeline**:
    - **Redis**:
        - Redis was selected as the primary in-memory database to store these user hashes. Due to its low-latency, high-throughput capabilities, Redis allowed for near-instantaneous lookups and updates, crucial for high-speed conversion tracking.
        - Redis’s **TTL (Time-To-Live)** functionality was utilized to automatically expire old session data, ensuring memory optimization and alignment with data retention policies.

    - **AWS Lambda**:
        - AWS Lambda functions handled the backend processing, creating and validating user hashes on every request. This serverless architecture enabled scalability by automatically adjusting to handle variable traffic volumes, particularly during peak ad traffic hours.
        - Lambda was also used to interact with Redis for hash creation, storage, and lookup, enabling a seamless flow from hash generation to conversion tracking.

    - **Kafka**:
        - Once a returning user was identified based on a hash match, an event was sent to **Apache Kafka**, which acted as our real-time data streaming platform. Kafka served as the pipeline for tracking updates, sending conversion events downstream to analytics and reporting services.
        - This real-time processing in Kafka enabled quick updates to conversion counts, which directly impacted revenue calculations and reporting accuracy.

    - **Additional Components**:
        - To ensure reliability and prevent duplicates, **hash collision detection** was integrated. This algorithm identified any potential hash conflicts and adjusted values if necessary, maintaining data integrity.
        - I implemented **rate limiting** logic to prevent duplicate requests from creating inflated conversion counts. This helped maintain accurate reporting, especially in high-traffic scenarios.

3. **Operational Monitoring and Analysis**:
    - To monitor and optimize the cookie-less pipeline, I developed a dedicated dashboard in **Grafana**. This dashboard visualized key metrics, including the number of conversions captured via the cookie-less solution, latency in hash lookups, and Redis performance metrics.
    - I set up **AWS CloudWatch** alerts for Lambda function error rates and Redis memory usage, allowing for proactive troubleshooting and immediate resolution of any service interruptions.

**Result**:  
The cookie-less tracking solution successfully increased Joveo’s conversion tracking accuracy by up to 50% across restricted browsers, directly improving revenue by capturing a significant volume of returning users who would otherwise be missed. The transition to a cookie-less model reduced dependency on third-party cookies, making our tracking approach future-proof and compliant with evolving privacy standards. The Redis-based architecture enabled rapid data retrieval, while Kafka ensured consistent data flow to our analytics services. The Grafana dashboard provided real-time visibility into the solution’s performance, supporting ongoing optimizations. Joveo fully adopted this solution, which has continued to generate measurable revenue gains.
