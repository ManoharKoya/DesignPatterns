**Situation**:  
At COSMOS Research Center, we needed a highly resilient and scalable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to support social media research. Our objective was to collect extensive social media data from various sources, including APIs for platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok, as well as third-party scraping tools like APIFY for restricted data sources. The pipeline had to standardize and process this data in real-time for both qualitative and quantitative analysis while maintaining high fault tolerance, adaptability, and meeting on-premises deployment requirements due to data sensitivity.

**Task**:  
As the lead for this project, I was responsible for designing an ETL pipeline that could reliably integrate diverse data sources, support rapid data ingestion, and process high data volumes on-premises. This pipeline also needed to maintain cloud-level reliability and fault tolerance, given the critical nature of real-time social media data for COSMOS research. I led a team of four experienced graduate students to develop a solution that would be resilient, scalable, and adaptable.

**Action**:
1. **Pipeline Architecture Design and Technologies**:
    - We opted for a microservices architecture using **Python** and **FastAPI** to create modular, independent data collection services tailored to each platform. To ensure high scalability, we used **Kubernetes** for orchestration, deploying services across a multi-server on-premises cluster. This setup allowed us to mimic cloud-level fault tolerance, high availability, and automatic recovery in an on-prem environment.
    - I utilized **Docker** to containerize each service, ensuring consistency across deployments and simplifying the scaling and management of microservices. The Dockerized services enabled smooth deployment and testing, even across varied server configurations.

2. **Integration of Go-Based Post-Processing Microservice**:
    - To manage the high-volume data events flowing from data collection to attribute computation, I developed a **Go-based post-processing microservice** that consumed standardized **DataObject Events (DOEs)** from **Kafka**. This microservice acted as a bridge between collection and computation, rate-limiting data consumption to prevent bottlenecks in downstream processing.
    - In Go, I leveraged **goroutines** for each consumer group, providing efficient multithreading to handle high throughput. **Channels** in Go were used to synchronize data between goroutines, allowing safe, asynchronous communication and helping the microservice handle backpressure seamlessly, maintaining steady data flow even under heavy load.

3. **Data Transformation and Storage**:
    - The data was transformed into a unified JSON format, termed **DataObject (DO)**, which we stored in **MongoDB**. This standardized format enabled compatibility across services, simplifying processing. By using **Redis** as a distributed in-memory store, we cached key data attributes for fast retrieval, reducing database strain.
    - The ETL pipeline performed essential computations, including sentiment analysis, toxicity scoring, and morality detection, in real time. Each analytic task was managed by a dedicated Kafka consumer group, creating a modular, scalable processing flow that allowed us to introduce new analysis types as needed without disrupting existing services.

4. **Monitoring and Observability with Grafana and Prometheus**:
    - To achieve cloud-level observability in our on-prem setup, we integrated **Grafana** and **Prometheus** for real-time monitoring and logging of system metrics. Prometheus collected data on service performance, such as ingestion rates, error counts, and latency, while Grafana visualized these metrics, allowing for detailed insights and quick issue identification.
    - Using Kubernetes, we deployed our microservices on multiple servers within the cluster, maintaining high availability and failover protection. This on-premises deployment strategy allowed us to overcome data sensitivity restrictions without compromising on fault tolerance and reliability.

**Result**:  
The pipeline we developed successfully collected, transformed, and processed high volumes of social media data, providing COSMOS researchers with reliable real-time analytics. The on-prem deployment achieved cloud-like performance and resilience, with a 95%+ uptime and the capacity to handle millions of daily events. The Go-based post-processing service enabled smooth rate-limited data flow, and Grafana dashboards provided clear visibility into key metrics, ensuring continuous optimization. This pipeline has allowed COSMOS to conduct in-depth social media analysis, supporting essential insights into social trends and behaviors.
